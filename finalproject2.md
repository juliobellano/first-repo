Project Overview
The Stock Portfolio Tracker is a web-based application designed to help users monitor and manage their stock investments. This application will provide real-time updates on stock prices, track profit and loss for individual stocks and the entire portfolio, and offer users a comprehensive view of their investment performance. The application will integrate with a stock price API to fetch live data, ensuring users always have the most up-to-date information.

Functionality
Live Profit/Loss Tracker: Users will be able to see real-time updates on the profit or loss for each stock in their portfolio as well as the overall portfolio performance.
Live Price Report: The application will display current stock prices, allowing users to stay informed about market conditions.
Current Price from Stock API: The application will fetch and display live stock prices using a reliable stock price API.
Motivation
Investing in the stock market requires constant monitoring and analysis of market trends. For individual investors, keeping track of multiple stocks can be challenging. The Stock Portfolio Tracker aims to simplify this process by providing a centralized platform where users can view real-time data and performance metrics for their investments. This tool will help investors make informed decisions and manage their portfolios more effectively.

Project Description
We have approximately three weeks to complete this project. Given the time constraints, we will focus on implementing core functionalities that demonstrate our knowledge of web server development, PHP, and relational databases. The project will be developed in phases, with each phase building upon the previous one to ensure steady progress.

Core Functions to Implement
User Interface (HTML & CSS):

Design and implement a responsive and user-friendly interface for the application.
Create pages for viewing the portfolio, individual stock details, and overall performance.
Backend Development (PHP):

Develop the backend logic to handle user requests, process data, and communicate with the stock price API.
Implement functionalities to fetch live stock prices and calculate profit/loss.
Database Integration (MariaDB):

Set up a relational database using MariaDB to store user information, stock data, and transaction history.
Develop PHP scripts to interact with the database for retrieving and updating data.
